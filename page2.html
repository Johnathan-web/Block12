    Video games have been a big part of my life ever since I was a kid. I remember spending countless hours playing classics on early consoles, immersing myself in the worlds they offered. As I've grown, gaming has remained one of my favorite pastimes, and I still dedicate a good portion of my spare time to it. Whether it's exploring expansive open-world adventures, competing in fast-paced multiplayer matches, or enjoying a quiet, story-driven indie game, video games are my way of unwinding and connecting with friends. They’ve been a consistent source of fun, challenge, and creativity throughout my life.

    Growing up, basketball was more than just a sport for me—it was my passion and escape. I spent countless hours on the court, perfecting my jump shot, dribbling drills, and dreaming of one day making it to the NBA. Those dreams fueled my dedication, and I worked hard to improve my game every chance I got. However, my journey was repeatedly derailed by injuries. Each time I seemed to get closer to my goals, another setback would force me off the court and into recovery. Despite the frustration and heartbreak of those injuries, my love for the game never faded. While the NBA dream may not have become a reality, basketball taught me resilience, discipline, and the importance of finding joy in the game itself.
